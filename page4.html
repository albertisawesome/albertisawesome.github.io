    <p>This is my other essay that I completed recently for my English class. As you know I love reading and so for a non App academy project I wanted to feature my second essay! Poisonwood Bible was my personal favorite novel that I had to write an essay about. In The Poison Wood Bible the act of Communion is highlighted. The themes of imperialism of the 1960s is portrayed and the moral questions of each character is questioned. Poison Wood Bible is my personal favorite book that I read this semester.</p>
