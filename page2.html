    <p>The project is called Faker Simulator. The name is based off a pro gamer known as Faker. It is a game created from p5.js, using drawn shapes to animate and create a fun and interactive game. The controls are simple. To go left, you press the "A" key. To go right, press the "D" key. Your goal is to navigate to the end of the hallway while navigating the narrow chambers. You have to have good reaction speed and reflexes to get far! If  you manage to get to the end then you win! You get points for passing each chamber. Good LUCK!</p>
