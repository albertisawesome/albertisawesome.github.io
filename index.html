    <p id="book">Hi! My name is Albert Chen. I an a senior at Pasadena High School. My favorite class is English. Ever since I was a little kid I enjoyed reading. The idea of learning by myself via books was very appealing to me. I would spend hours reading books and enjoyed visiting the local library. Books would keep me entertained for a long time. English class is an extension of that hobby. I especially enjoy reading books in my literature class and discussing it with my peers. In my free time I enjoy playing video games and building my foundation.
