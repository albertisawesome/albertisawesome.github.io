    <p>Showcasing my Macbeth Essay that I created for my Literature class. The essay was very challenging. I worked day in and day out to complete it. The complex character of Macbeth is shown and I had to analyze the importance of the theme of violence. It shows the significance of certain themes. I think this essay was fun because it challenged me. The hard work paid off and I was proud when I acheived a good score on this essay.</p>
